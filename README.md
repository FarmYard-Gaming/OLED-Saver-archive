# OLED-Saver-archive
Trial repository: an archive of OLED Saver's code(?) on GitHub. This isn't my app, but it's on here for safekeeping.

The OLED Saver app is used to help mitigate the effects of screen burn-in and flickering common on OLED screens, for whatever reason.
Extended periods of time where the phone is left on a static image (e.g. TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, even Chrome apps) are the most common causes.
That's what this is for.
I can't find the app in the Play Store, and Reddit acknowledges it less and less. There's no indication of the owner's whereabouts or details.
Thus, I've uploaded it here.

If you just want to use it as is, feel free to download the APK as-is and use it. The app walks you through what to do, so play around.

If you're skeptical about it - I don't blame you, that's why I uploaded it here in the first place.
I used decompiler.com to... decompile the app. This (should?) show all the code it uses.
Minds more knowledgeable than mine can verify that, but now it's out in the open it's ready for public scrutiny.

If development of the app continues, it can help phones for which this app doesn't yet work well with, which is a win for everyone.

The README file will be updated over time as changes happen.
